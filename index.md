I am a professional in the finance industry seeking to change careers to tech.  I have been coding off and on since 2000, starting with C++,  and studied Computer Science at Bloomsburg University from 2006-2008 primarily focused on Java. 

My more recent endeavors have been learning SQL and Python as a way to re-engage myself without rehashing previous languages.
